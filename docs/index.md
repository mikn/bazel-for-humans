You're not alone. Many developers find themselves in the same situation - using Bazel because they have to, not because they want to. But here's the thing: **Bazel is actually awesome when it clicks**.

## Why This Guide Exists

This isn't another technical manual. It's a guide written by developers, for developers, to help you:

- üéØ **Actually understand** why Bazel exists and what problems it solves
- üî® **Build confidently** without relying on copy-paste from ancient Stack Overflow posts
- üåç **Connect the dots** between your code, your builds, and your deployment environments
- üöÄ **Master modern Bazel** with Bzlmod and leave legacy WORKSPACE files behind

## What Makes This Guide Different?

1. **Human First**: We explain concepts in plain language, with real-world analogies
2. **Modern Practices**: Focus on current Bazel features and best practices
3. **Practical Examples**: Real-world scenarios you'll actually encounter
4. **Bottom-Up Learning**: Start with the basics and build up to advanced concepts

## Getting Started

Ready to make Bazel work for you? Start with these core concepts:

- [Core Concepts](/concepts/core-concepts.html): Understand the building blocks
- [Build vs Runtime](/concepts/build-vs-runtime.html): Master the key distinction
- [Dependencies and Actions](/concepts/dependencies-and-actions.html): Control your build process
- [Unified Environment](/concepts/unified-environment.html): Connect all the pieces

Or jump straight to our [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started/) if you're eager to get your hands dirty.

Remember: Bazel is a tool meant to serve you, not the other way around. Let's make it work for humans.
